          This app was created because there seems to be a lack of understanding
          about the powers of the police. <br /><br />
          This quiz has two purposes: information and education. <br /><br />
          Education: Teaching people what their rights mean when they get
          arrested, the app takes you through a series of questions about
          arrest, stop and search, and search warrants in the UK. <br /><br />
          Information: As you go through the quiz, your answer choices are
          recorded and saved. Once the quiz is complete you can see how you did
          compared to everyone else. By collecting this data we are able to
          understand how much the public understand their rights when
          interacting with the police, and what they are specifically getting
          wrong. The hope is that this can become the basis for stronger,
          targeted education tools in the future.
